			<h2>What Movies mean to me</h2>
			<p>Since I was a little kid, I have always enjoyed watching movies. Growing up in Hollywood, CA, I watched movies with my friends, by myself, and even took several dates to see them! Movies helped shape my understanding of the world and would gave me the opportunity to continually exercise my imagination and develop some of the lens/filters from which I observe the world.</p>
			<p>As I grew up, I kept up this "tradition" of going to see the latest movies at the local movie theatre or at home (I can binge watch up to as many as 4 movies in a day!). Movies are such a wonderful medium and will always be a integral part of my life.</p>
			<p>It's important to note that I am by no means a certified film critic and that the following list was made based soley off of my personal opinions and preferences. Selecting the movies I want to list for each genre was pretty hard (so many good movies out there!) and many of them can be easily categorized in multiple genres</p>
			<p>So, without further ado, here is my list of my top 10 favorite movie genres!</p>
		</div>

<!-- Sci-fi -->

			<h2>Science Fiction</h2>
			<p>One of the reasons why I like Sci-Fi is because this genre is almost boundless as far as story telling and character selection is concerned. This genre will usually take place in far away lands (and space) and has presented the film world with some of the most creative and clever stories ever told. Most of these stories are "epic" in scale and include large battle scenes, intricate love storylines, beautiful imagery, and awesome musical scores!</p>
			<p>I also enjoy the fact that this genre provides me with stories that allow me to fantasize and let my imagination run wild and free! I can fantasize about being some super-hero saving an alien world or use my imagination to continue to think about and explore the worlds/characters that the movie has given me long after I leave the theatre.</p>
			<p>Here is a list of my favorite movies: The Star Wars Saga, The Jurassic Park Franchise, Interstellar, The Matrix Trilogy, Ex-Machina, Minority Report, Moon, Inception, Tron (original and Legacy), and Avatar.

			<h2>Pixels for Pixar</h2>
			<p><br>Disclaimer:<br></br>With the majority of my animated films coming from the Disney subsidiary, Pixar, I can't help but include a majority of my Pixar films on this list.</p>
			<p>There was no way I was going to skip the world of animated movies on my list of my favorite movie genres! What I enjoy about animated movies is that they will always have some sort of message or moral that is presented through the use of anthropomorphic computer animations or hand-drawn cartoons. With the ability to literally create any world and any storyline imaginable, so many great stories can be told in such creative ways!</p>
			<p>Here are some of the animated films I love: The Toy Story Franchise, Wall-E, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Lion King, Chicken Run, Up, Spirited Away, A Scanner Darkly, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.

			<h1 class="parallax__layer--base">Drama</h1>

	<section class="module content">

			<h2>Swim in the Deep End</h2>
			<p>Drama! This is a classic and timeless genre who's historic roots can be traced back to the Greeks. A good drama film develops characters that the I can emotionally invest in. These types of movies will focus largely on well-developed characters and their stuggles in dealing with their complex environments and their interactions with other well-developed characters.</p>
			<p>The reason I enjoy dramas is because they allow me to vicariously see and feel emotions and situations that I would probably never encounter in my life. These kinds of movies will often times feel like a character sudy of some sort of archetype or a study of human psychology/social psychology!
			<p>Some of my favorite dramas are: Reign on Me, There will be Blood, Black Swan, Good Will Hunting, Fight Club, The Social Network, Saving Private Ryan, The Wolf of Wallstreet, The Big Short, and Reservoir Dogs.

			<h2>Navigating a Dynamic Emotional Landscape</h2>
			<p>Before I get into why I enjoy a good romantic movie, it's important that I cover what I think a romantic movie should be and what it should do. In my opinion, a good romantic movie should be able to deconstruct the dynamic, and often complex, emotional themes of love, jealousy, and heartbreak and present it to the viewer in a way that is relatable and easily identifiable.
			<p>Good romantic movies will break down the intricacies of romantic relationships and tell a story of how the characters deal with their emotions as they process what's happening around them in a way that everyone can relate with in their own personal lives. Some movies will do this through the use of humour a happy ending (like a romantic comedy) while others will commit 100% to tapping into our emotional cores and dive right into the material without holding back (like "Blue Valentine").<p>
			<p>Some of my favorite romantic movies are: Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Silver Linings Playbook, 500 Days of Summer, Foretting Sarah Marshall, Don Jon, Yes Man, Peaceful Warrior, Stanger than Fiction, and Crazy, Stupid, Love.

<!-- Suspense -->
	<a name="suspense"></a>
	<section class="module parallax parallax-5">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="parallax__layer--base">Suspense</h1>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="module content">
		<div class="container">
			<h2>Edge of my seat</h2>
			<p>Some of the best feelings I can experience from a movie usually stem from plot twists (especially the one's I didn't see coming!) and can be best categorized as the emotions associated with suspense. Movies that do a good job using red-herrings and keep me guessing as to what will happen next have a special place in my heart. These kind of movies do a great job of balancing my hopes and anxieties for the narrative.</p>
			<p>Suspensefull movies cover a lot of categories and will usually have some cross-over in genres (think political thriller or horror thillers). What makes these kinds of movies special is how they build suspense through our primal emotions (dread, anticipation, and excitment) in order to keep a movie-viewer hooked until the climax. There's a feeling of exhilaration and adrenaline that comes over the viewer once the climax is reached, and it is one of the important elements in a good suspense film.
			<p>Some of my favorite suspensful movies include: Sicario, The Invitation, Gone Girl, John Wick, Side Effects, Gravity, The Bourne Series, The Sixth Sense, The Silence of the Lambs, and Paranormal Activity.

			<h2>The sounds of laughter</h2>
			<p>There's nothing quite like it. Despite enjoying a good cerebral puzzle from a political thriller or the rush from a suspenseful movie, I have to save a spot on this list for the genre of comedy. Comedy offers me the chance to relieve stress and dive into a whimsical world! What can be better than being entertained while having a good laugh?</p>
			<p>Categorically, the comedy genre is pretty diverse and includes a wide range of movie styles. My favorites are dark comedies (movies that use humor to take on serious or taboo subject matter) and "Fish out of water" comedies (movies where the main character is in an unusual environment). All comedies, despite the wide range of styles, are all connected by a single essential ingredient, humor.</p>
			<p>Some of the movie titles I enjoy include: Tropic Thunder, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, This is the End, The Big Lebowski, Forrest Gump, Pineapple Express, Frank, Birdman, Project X, and Seven Psychopaths.
